# Modelling Sandbox

### Overview
This repository contains simple examples of SIA-based ice-sheet models aimed to serve as an introduction to numerical ice-sheet modelling and as a playground.

- `introduction_to_numerical_ice_sheet_modelling.ipynb`: Contains examples for simple diffusion and advection models (FTCS) as well as a simple ice-sheet model based on the Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA).
